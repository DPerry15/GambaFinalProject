Revision 1: Created the Front end

Revision 2: Deleted the Front end that was in github so I could move an API in a folder directory with it

Revision 3: Added in the API alongside my new Front End to put them both together
            Plan is to finish implementing the API to the front end to display the tables for each case
  
Revision 4: added in the tables for the website sadly it doesnt work and i ended up losing some of the major progress i made so it is not fully done but atleast a 50% :))
